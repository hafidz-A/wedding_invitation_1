## Project goal

Multi-tenant SaaS for premium wedding-invitation websites. One cinematic template, many couples — each couple = one row in the `invitations` table, each with their own slug (`/<slug>`), password-protected admin dashboard (`/<slug>/dashboard`), RSVP database, and gift confirmation database.

**Origin:** This project was scaffolded from `c:\Users\arifi\Downloads\Wedding Website Design new\` (a Vite + React wedding template with 14+ cinematic sections). All section components were copied **byte-identical** here, only the routing/data-loading layer changed. The Vite project remains at that path as a fallback / reference and **should not be edited from here**.

---

## Tech stack (decided, do not re-evaluate without asking)

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) | Stable for React 18.3.1, supports server components + cookies for auth gate |
| Animation | motion 12 + gsap 3.15 | Existing template depends on both, kept unchanged |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + Storage + RLS) | User chose this — credentials in `.env.local` |
| Admin auth | bcryptjs + HTTP-only cookies, per-slug session | One password per couple, no Supabase Auth email login |
| Forms | react-hook-form 7.55 | Existing pattern in Rsvp + WeddingGift |
| Hosting | Vercel | Subdomain in MVP, custom `.com`/`.id` later as Premium tier |

**Do not introduce**: Tailwind, shadcn, MUI, or any UI library — the template is hand-styled with CSS Modules and CSS variables. Adding a UI library would conflict with the existing design system.

## Multi-tenant model

```
weddingsite.com/                  → marketing / showcase
weddingsite.com/<slug>            → public invitation (server fetches Supabase, no auth)
weddingsite.com/<slug>/dashboard  → admin editor (password-gated, per-slug cookie)
```

- 1 template, N couples. Each `invitations` row owns its own `config` JSONB (same shape as `src/config/pageConfig.js`).
- Pasangan A's password/session NEVER grants access to Pasangan B's dashboard — session cookie is scoped `path: /<slug>`.
- Bootstrap new couples via `node scripts/create-invitation.mjs <slug> <password> [plan]`.

`scripts/create-invitation.mjs` — CLI to bootstrap a couple's record (bcrypt hashes the password, inserts with `is_published=true`).

---

## Current status (Sprint 0 — complete)

✅ Next.js scaffold (112 files)
✅ Public invitation route fetches from Supabase, falls back to bundled demo config when env vars absent
✅ Dashboard route with per-slug password gate (bcrypt + HTTP-only cookie, session is `password_hash.slice(0, 32)`)
✅ API routes: `POST /api/rsvp`, `POST /api/gift` — resolve slug server-side, insert via service_role
✅ Rsvp + WeddingGift sections POST to those endpoints when `slug` prop present; fall back to simulated success when not
✅ Supabase schema in `../Wedding Website Design new/supabase/schema.sql` (5 tables + RLS + storage bucket)
✅ Bootstrap script `scripts/create-invitation.mjs`

## Next sprints (priority order)

### Sprint 1 — Block-based editor (the big one)
The dashboard editor tab is currently a JSON preview stub. Build the real editor:
- Left panel: list of `sections[]` from the invitation's `config`, drag-reorder
- Right panel: live preview iframe of `/<slug>?preview=1`
- Per-section: inline edit text fields (title, subtitle, intro), image upload to `invitation-media/<invitation_id>/...` bucket, GIF support
- "Publish" toggle that flips `is_published`
- Save = upsert `config` JSONB to Supabase via server action (NOT API route — server actions are simpler for auth-gated mutations)
- **Auth**: every save must re-verify the session cookie matches the slug being saved

### Sprint 2 — Dashboard data views
- `DashboardClient.tsx` `rsvps` tab: list of RSVP submissions, total attending count, export to CSV
- `gifts` tab: list with status workflow (`pending` → `verified` → `thanked`), total amount sum
- Server actions for status updates

### Sprint 3 — 3 template color variants
- `themes.js` already has 4 themes (`warmCream`, `darkLuxury`, `emeraldGarden`, `skyEditorial`). Trim/curate to 3 named templates: `classic`, `modern`, `garden`.
- `invitations.template_id` already exists. Wire it: `InvitationView` reads `invitation.template_id` and passes to ThemeProvider as a top-level theme override that supersedes per-section `theme:`.
- Dashboard "Template" tab → switcher with thumbnails.
- **Risk:** sections that hardcode colors instead of using CSS variables will break. Audit: `Rsvp.module.css` uses `var(--color-coral)` ✓ but check Hero gate gradients which currently hardcode `#E8553E`.

### Sprint 4 — Pricing gates + Vercel deploy
- Plan enforcement (free vs basic vs premium): max RSVPs, custom domain, watermark removal, gallery photo count
- Vercel project + env vars
- Subdomain routing (`<slug>.weddingsite.com`) via `middleware.ts` rewriting to `/<slug>` path

## Conventions to preserve

- **Section components stay byte-identical with the Vite project** — when in doubt, diff against `../Wedding Website Design new/src/sections/<Name>/<Name>.jsx`. Animation knobs (`SECTION_HEIGHT_VH`, ease curves, stagger windows) are the result of many iterations — do not "improve" them.
- **CSS Modules + CSS variables** for all section styling. No Tailwind, no styled-components.
- **No `import.meta.env`** — that's Vite. Use `process.env.NODE_ENV` in Next.
- **`'use client'`** lives on all section/component/hook files. Server components are: `src/app/**/page.tsx` and `src/app/api/**/route.ts`. Don't sprinkle 'use server' inside section components.
- **Secrets discipline:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` only in `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` and `src/app/api/**`. Never reference it from a `'use client'` file.
- **User language:** the user (`arifinhafidz68@gmail.com`) writes in Bahasa Indonesia, mixed casual register. Reply in Bahasa for explanation, English for code/comments. Indonesian wedding-card domain conventions: bank account info section is critical (already shipped as WeddingGift).

## Known gotchas

1. **Demo invitation password hash:** the seed row in `schema.sql` has a placeholder hash (`$2b$10$REPLACE_WITH_REAL_HASH_OF_demo1234`) — login won't work with `demo1234` until replaced. Use `scripts/create-invitation.mjs` instead of relying on the seed row.
2. **Fallback config:** `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` falls back to bundled `pageConfig.js` if (a) env vars missing, OR (b) invitation row's `config` JSONB is empty `{}`. This is intentional for first-run UX but **must be removed before launching to real customers** — they'd see the demo content if they haven't filled their own.
3. **Lazy section imports + Suspense:** SectionRenderer uses `React.lazy()`. Works in Next 14 but means each section is a separate chunk — that's fine, but be aware that hot-reload during edits can show the SectionSkeleton briefly.
4. **GSAP `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)` at module top:** runs on the client only because the file is `'use client'`. Don't move that call inside a component — pin-spacer recalculation costs increase.
5. **BotanicalBorder.tsx** is the global decorative layer + per-section sketch — heavy DOM. If perf gets bad on mobile, gate behind a `prefers-reduced-motion` query (already partially done in OurStory).

## How to test the current scaffold

```powershell
cd c:\Users\arifi\Downloads\wedding-saas-next
npm install                                  # one-time, ~3 min
# Edit .env.local with Supabase URL + 2 keys
# Run supabase/schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor first
node scripts/create-invitation.mjs rizky-amara demo1234 premium
npm run dev
```

Then:
- http://localhost:3000 → marketing
- http://localhost:3000/rizky-amara → invitation (loads from Supabase; if config is empty `{}`, shows bundled demo)
- http://localhost:3000/rizky-amara/dashboard → login `demo1234` → stub dashboard

- `../Wedding Website Design new/supabase/schema.sql` — full DB schema, run this in Supabase
- `../Wedding Website Design new/CLAUDE.md` — original Section 2 (Our Story) polaroid spec — not yet implemented in either project
- `../Wedding Website Design new/README.md` — long-form architecture write-up of the template

Avoid editing these from this session — they belong to the upstream Vite project.
